Below is a high-level breakdown, presented in sequential tasks, on how to integrate a simple, file-based knowledge lookup into your WebRTC (or WebSocket) real-time agent application.

Step 1: Establish a File Storage Approach
	1.	Place text files in a predictable, accessible location on the webserver (e.g., a files/ directory).
	2.	Ensure the webserver can serve these files or allow the back-end to read them directly from disk.

Step 2: Define a Single Tool/Function for File Retrieval
	1.	In your back-end code, introduce a function definition such as getFileContent(fileName).
	2.	Have this function read the specified file and return its text content.
	•	For instance, tellyfeatures.txt or techsupport.txt.

Multiple Approaches:
	•	Direct Local File Read: If the app and files are on the same server, read them directly from the filesystem.
	•	HTTP Endpoint: Alternatively, expose an endpoint that returns file contents.
	•	S3 Integration: Swap out the local read with an S3 download in future phases.

Step 3: Configure the Agent to Use the Function
	1.	In the system prompt (session tools configuration), introduce the function:
	•	Name: "getFileContent"
	•	Description: Summarize what it does (e.g. “Retrieve the contents of a text file for knowledge-based lookup”).
	•	Parameters: One parameter, fileName: string, that identifies which file to load.
	2.	Set tool_choice to "auto" so the agent can autonomously decide to call it.
	3.	In the system instructions, add lines guiding the model on when to call getFileContent:
	•	Example: “If the user’s question is about Telly software, call getFileContent('tellyfeatures.txt').”

Step 4: Detect When the Agent Calls getFileContent
	1.	Watch for function_call items in the real-time conversation events (response.function_call_arguments.done or upon response.done).
	2.	Parse the JSON arguments from the item. You’ll see something like:

{ "fileName": "tellyfeatures.txt" }


	3.	Verify the file name is one of the recognized knowledge-base files.

Step 5: Execute the File Retrieval
	1.	In your back-end event handling code, when you detect a function call to getFileContent:
	•	Call your local or server-based function getFileContent(fileName).
	•	This returns the file’s contents as a string.

Step 6: Pass the File Results Back Into the Conversation
	1.	Create a new conversation item of type function_call_output:

{
  "type": "conversation.item.create",
  "item": {
    "type": "function_call_output",
    "call_id": "<the call_id from the function_call item>",
    "output": "{\"content\": \"<file content here>\"}"
  }
}


	2.	Invoke response.create again so that the model can incorporate the returned text into its answer.

Step 7: Prompt the Model for an Updated Answer
	1.	After sending the function output item, send a follow-up response.create request to generate the final user-facing response:
	•	The model now has the text from the file in context.
	•	It can use that text to form a detailed answer.

Step 8: Validate in Real Time
	1.	Test by asking relevant questions in your web app’s interface, ensuring the agent calls the file retrieval function when it should.
	2.	Confirm that once the file content is returned, the agent continues properly and provides enriched answers.

Step 9: Extend or Generalize (Optional)
	1.	Expand to multiple files by instructing the model about each file’s relevance:
	•	Telly features: tellyfeatures.txt
	•	Tech support: techsupport.txt
	2.	Move to a Database (e.g., Postgres or PGVector) after the proof of concept. This replaces step 5 with a vector-based or SQL-based retrieval.
	3.	Add Basic Filters or more advanced prompt instructions if you need the agent to be selective about certain content.

Outcome:
Following these steps gives a simple mechanism for your real-time agent to “read” from external files and integrate that knowledge into its replies, all via a straightforward function call setup.
