1. Project Setup and Environment Configuration
	•	Create a basic project folder for the proof of concept.
	•	Initialize any build system or bundler if desired (e.g., simple HTML/JS with no build step, or a minimal setup with a bundler).
	•	Place an .env file (or similar) inside the project to store the OpenAI API key. Make sure it’s not committed to source control.

2. Single Page Structure
	•	Create a single HTML file (index.html) that holds all UI elements:
	•	A large display area for the transcript (text) and status logs.
	•	A “Connect” button to establish the real-time voice session.
	•	An area or element to show images from Dall-E or user uploads.
	•	A hidden or inline file input for image upload.
	•	Attach a single JavaScript file (e.g., app.js) to control all client-side logic.

3. Basic UI Elements
	•	Connect Button: Triggers the setup of the WebRTC audio connection to the OpenAI RealTime endpoint.
	•	Transcript Display: A scrollable container that will dynamically show messages from both the user and the agent.
	•	Status/Logs Panel: A smaller panel or inline text area that displays connection status updates and any relevant system messages (e.g., “connecting…”, “error occurred”).
	•	Image Upload Control: When the system requests an image or the user wants to provide one, this control should open a file chooser. The chosen image is displayed in the transcript area, then sent to OpenAI for analysis or displayed after generation.

4. WebRTC and Audio Setup
	1.	Prompt for Microphone Access: Use the browser’s built-in APIs (getUserMedia) to capture microphone input.
	2.	Establish Peer Connection: Create a new RTCPeerConnection instance.
	3.	Add Audio Track: Once the microphone is granted, add the audio track to the connection.
	4.	Generate and Exchange SDP: Implement a signaling flow to exchange offer/answer with the OpenAI RealTime API endpoint. This typically involves:
	•	Creating an offer (createOffer)
	•	Setting local description (setLocalDescription)
	•	Sending the SDP offer to the server
	•	Receiving the SDP answer from the server
	•	Setting the remote description (setRemoteDescription)
	5.	Handle ICE Candidates: Monitor the icecandidate events, sending candidates to the server and receiving them from the server until the connection is established.
	6.	Audio Playback: Create an audio element or use the Web Audio API to play the remote audio track once it’s available from the incoming peer connection.

5. Connecting to the OpenAI RealTime Model
	1.	Authentication: Include the stored OpenAI API key in your requests or signaling messages (using the .env variable in your build or a secure environment).
	2.	Session Initiation: After the user clicks “Connect,” establish a session with the model (gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview).
	3.	Audio Streaming: The microphone audio is sent to the model, and the response is played back in the browser’s audio element.

6. Handling Text and Transcript
	•	In parallel with audio, the model’s textual responses can be received through a WebSocket or specific real-time text protocol.
	•	Insert each new message into the transcript display as soon as it arrives.
	•	Tag each message with a speaker identifier (“You” vs. “OpenAI Agent”).

7. Function or Tool Calling Logic
	•	Incorporate logic in the client-side to detect when the agent wants to:
	1.	Analyze an Image: The agent might send a structured request that indicates image analysis is needed.
	•	Display a button or prompt to let the user upload an image.
	•	Once uploaded, display the image in the transcript area.
	•	Send the image data (base64 or binary form) to the model for analysis.
	•	Receive the textual response and speak it out to the user.
	2.	Generate an Image (Dall-E): The agent might send a structured request for image generation.
	•	Invoke the Dall-E API for image creation.
	•	Retrieve the generated image.
	•	Display it in the transcript area.
	•	Allow an accompanying audio message to play once the image is shown.

8. Integrating Image Flow
	•	Uploading Images:
	•	Implement a click event on the upload button (visible only when needed or always available in the UI).
	•	Use an <input type="file"> element to select an image.
	•	Convert the file to base64 or send it directly as a blob if the API supports that.
	•	Displaying Images:
	•	Inject the resulting file or URL into the transcript for user confirmation.
	•	If it’s a Dall-E response, place the returned image link in the transcript area.

9. Real-Time Synchronization
	•	Maintain a state machine or simple flags to track if the system is currently in the middle of:
	•	Sending an audio message
	•	Waiting for a textual or audio reply
	•	Waiting for an image analysis or generation response
	•	Update the status/log panel accordingly (e.g., “Awaiting response,” “Analyzing image,” “Generating image”).

10. Error Handling and Logging
	•	Listen for and log WebRTC-related errors (connection dropped, ICE failure).
	•	Capture any exceptions during audio capture or playback.
	•	Show user-friendly notifications in the status/log area.
	•	If an image upload fails or the Dall-E API returns an error, post the error to the transcript area or status panel.

11. Testing the Flow
	1.	Initial Connection: Click “Connect,” grant microphone permission, verify the agent’s audio response.
	2.	Transcript Logging: Speak or send a text prompt and watch the transcript update.
	3.	Image Analysis: Ask a vision-related question, upload an image, confirm that a response arrives.
	4.	Image Generation: Request an image be generated, confirm the display and audio confirmation.
	5.	Edge Cases: Briefly test dropping the connection or refreshing mid-conversation to confirm the session re-initializes gracefully.

12. UI Polish (Optional Enhancements)
	•	Style the transcript and images for a better user experience.
	•	Animate incoming messages or fade in images as they appear.
	•	Add optional microphone mute/unmute or volume controls.
	•	Provide a visual indicator that audio is being captured (e.g., a small audio level meter).
