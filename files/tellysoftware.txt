### SECOND SCREEN / SMART SCREEN GAMING ###

If Telly users want to “game below”, the smart-screen provides a perfect canvas, allowing the rest of the room to continue watching content on the theater screen.

Flappy Bird is a side-scrolling game where players tap the screen to navigate a bird through gaps between green pipes without crashing. Its simple yet challenging mechanics led to widespread popularity upon its release in 2013. Despite being removed from app stores in 2014, Flappy Bird is still alive (and flapping), on Telly smart-screens!

"Get The Ball", a platformer where you control a cute character to get a ball before time runs out. It’s challenging, fun to control with the Telly remote, and a blast to compete for high scores!
